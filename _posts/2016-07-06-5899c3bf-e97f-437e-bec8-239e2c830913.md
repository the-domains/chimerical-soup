I spent some time today looking over the critiques I've received for "Girls for Spiders," a horror novelette that I wrote recently, and I got to thinking about black widows. They're preeeeetty. 

Thanks to Flickr user Laurence Grayson for this picture of a black widow, or "Redback" as he calls them.
