  Brewing the coffee and settling in to work on Tree of the Bear-Man, my
  novel-length WIP. It's 5:30 in the morning and the outside world (the world
  with bears in it) is dark. But I can hear the neighborhood mockingbird going
  nuts outside in the tallest tree, so that means it's morning, right?
