I'm writing this WIP in an extended, fictionalized version of Livermore, CA's Sycamore Grove. The other day, I went there with my fabulous husband and my fabulous four-year-old, and we walked for a lazy forty minutes along the trail. I was particularly struck by the musicality of the place-the burble of the creek, the scuttling of lizards in the grass, the clucking of angry little birds, the rustle of large, star-like leaves rubbing together.   

The weather was perfect and my little son was overcome with enthusiasm for NATURE and LEARNING which is always a plus in my book. But I can't get over my daydreams. I want to go back, alone, with a journal, so I can experience the place, really soak it in, and bring those details to the WIP. Gotta make that happen before the summer sets in for real, yo.

Thanks to the National Parks Service for uploading this public domain image to Flickr. It is so pretty.
