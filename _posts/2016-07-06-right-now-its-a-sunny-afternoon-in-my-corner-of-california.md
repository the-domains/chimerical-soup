  Right now it's a sunny afternoon in my corner of California. The grape leaves
  are draped over the crossbar on the front porch and the sun is just blazing
  out there, sunburning my hollyhocks and carrot flowers. But - bless air
  conditioning - it's cool inside. My son is playing Minecraft and I have a
  soda. And chocolate. Oh, and also this super cool new Grid site to play with.
  Can I just mention that I have excite? Very wow!

Right now it's a sunny afternoon in my corner of California. The grape leaves are draped over the crossbar on the front porch and the sun is just blazing out there, sunburning my hollyhocks and carrot flowers. But - bless air conditioning - it's cool inside. My son is playing Minecraft and I have a soda. And chocolate. Oh, and also this super cool new Grid site to play with. Can I just mention that I have excite? Very wow! 

Yesterday I wrote "The Networker," a short, near-future horror story. The pieces I've written lately have been very precisely plotted out. I've been building them brick by brick according to rules and techniques. Yesterday, for a change of pace, I opened up my copy of Write or Die and just went for it, blitzing along stream-of-consciousness style until a draft came out, and I found myself writing "END" on a story that had topped out above 6,000 words.

6,000 words is nothing to laugh at, but it took a long time today to edit it into shape. It's a grisly little horror story, and as I was reading it out loud to myself to check for sound, something warm and wet touched my foot. I screamed.

But it was my son, all four years of him. While I was reading my gruesome little tale, he'd crept under the table. He was listening. And he loves me. So he kissed my feet.

Forget the pee-in-my-pants terror I felt when something wet touched my foot, now I have to deal with the fact that my precious little heard me talking about death, death, death and violence and horror. But I suppose he'll survive. And so will I, if my heart will stop fluttering like that. Ow, heart. Ow.

Anyway, I've shipped "The Networker" off to my 'zine of choice. I don't know how well the story will do, or if I'll like it in two weeks, but I do know this: it was a pleasure to step away from the methodical plotting I've been grinding away at of late and to simply blast words from fingers-to-page. And faster.

Maybe, if I'm lucky and kind and wise and good, I'll internalize these rules and methods and techniques into my own sort of story stew and be able to dash off a story that has structure without having to stop and thinky-think every minute or so. What a relief that would be.
