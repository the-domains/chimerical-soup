  After a long summer of rest and depression, going back to work is an exercise

After a long summer of rest and depression, going back to work is an exercise in unrestrained exuberance. I guess my resilience reserves filled right back up while I binge-watched Stranger Things and wrote short stories, novelettes, and started a novel. \*flexes muscles\* Back into the fray!
